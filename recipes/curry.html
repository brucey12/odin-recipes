    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a delectable soup that curry enjoyers will especially savour. I
      love a good soup after a day on the mountain, and this is one of my
      go-to's!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 butternut squash</li>
      <li>1 tbs butter</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>&frac34; tsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
      <li>&frac14; tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 tbs butter</li>
      <li>&frac12; chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 tsp yellow curry powder</li>
      <li>1 (13 oz) can coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 &frac12; cups vegetable stock</li>
      <li>&frac14; tsp grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup pumpkin seeds</li>
      <li>1 pinch nutmeg, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place butternut squash in a baking dish, flesh side up. Brush 1
        tablespoon melted butter over the flesh and top with 1/2 teaspoon salt,
        1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and cayenne pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove squash
        from oven and cool for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a large stockpot over medium heat; add 1 tablespoon butter. Cook
        and stir onion in the melted butter for 2 minutes. Add curry powder;
        cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in coconut milk; bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop flesh from the butternut squash and add to coconut milk mixture;
        mix in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice,
        vegetable stock, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
        to low, and simmer until soup is heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend soup using an immersion blender on low speed. Simmer until soup is
        smooth and thickened, about 20 minutes more. Add more vegetable stock
        for a thinner consistency and season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle soup into bowls and top each with pumpkin seeds and a pinch of
        nutmeg.
      </li>
    </ol>
