      <li>&frac12; sugar, packed down</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup honey</li>
      <li>&frac13; melted coconut oil</li>
      <li>&frac13; unsweetened smooth applesauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp orange zest</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup orange juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded carrots (about 4 large)</li>
      <li>1 cup grated apple (about 1 large)</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup raisins</li>
      <li>&frac12; chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick
        spray or use greased/sprayed cupcake liners. This recipe yields 14–16
        muffins, so prepare a second muffin pan in the same manner or bake in
        batches and reserve leftover batter at room temperature for when the
        first batch is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and flaxseed
        together in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, brown sugar,
        honey, oil, applesauce, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla together
        until combined. Whisk in the carrots and apples. Pour these wet
        ingredients into the dry ingredients, stir a few times with a wooden
        spoon or rubber spatula, then add the raisins and pecans. Fold
        everything together until just combined and no pockets of flour remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Bake
        for 5 minutes at 425°F; then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce
        the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 18 minutes
        or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total
        time these muffins take in the oven is about 23–24 minutes, give or
        take. Allow the muffins to cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer
        to a wire rack to cool until ready to eat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover leftover muffins and store at room temperature for 2 days or in
        the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
      </li>
